Because I we sometimes need save a WebP image as another format, I first found this > [Save Image as Type](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabfmnliflodkdafenbcpjdlppllnemd), and simply updated the extension.

As per the [README.md](https://github.com/cuixiping/Save-Image-as-Type#readme) for [that extension](https://github.com/cuixiping/Save-Image-as-Type), it was based on these:

参考作品1: [Save Image As Type 1.0.5](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibcmpbjdpbkbdgejlchkllfiagebgbjp)
(无法运行)

参考作品2: [Save Image As PNG 1.0.2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkokmeaibnajheohncaamjggkanfbphi)
(只能保存为PNG，不能保存为JPG和WebP)
